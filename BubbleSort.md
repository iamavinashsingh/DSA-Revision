# Bubble Sort

Imagine morning assembly in school.
All students must stand according to height — shortest in front, tallest at the back.
But today, they’re standing randomly.

What the teacher does (Bubble Sort):

- The teacher looks at two students standing next to each other.
- If the taller student is in front of the shorter one,
👉 the teacher tells them to swap places.
- The teacher moves to the next pair and does the same check.
- This continues till the last student.

After one round:

- The tallest student reaches the back of the line.

- Then the teacher starts again from the front of the line.

- They repeat this until:

- Everyone is standing properly height-wise,

- No swapping is needed.
